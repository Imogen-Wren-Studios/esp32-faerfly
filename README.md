## Project Outline

_The project is a business card that can be handed out at gigs and work, and also a fun project to build!_

### Requirements
 1. A PCB business card I can hand out to people at gigs / work to advertise myself
 2. A fun electronics project or thing

### Ideas
 1. A Ripping Beast of a fuzz I built many years ago out of recycled parts from old broadcast cameras, and have never successfully managed to replicate.
    **Disadvantages:**
    - Limited use as soldering project due to SMD parts
    - Wont be seen once it goes into box
    - Difficulties with supply of Ukranian Transistor


 2. An AtTiny85 based mini pocket lightshow. Rechargable and interactive. Probably get it fabbed so it isnt a soldering project, but include a programming port so it can be reprogrammed easily.
     **Advantages:**
    - Fun programming challenge - Can link to repo with working code in case of bricking
    - Card more likely to be used in the open and interacted with over time
    - Would have to be handed out with everything attached
    - Could exclude battery and make a point of indicating to reuse broken disposible vape for battery. Recycling electronic waste! 


 4. Capacitive touch instrument. Extermal power supply, 9v based for ease. Basic Light Show included?
    - Analog or Digital?  
    **Analog Advantages**
    - More motivation to treat it as a soldering excercise rather than a programming one.
    - More likely to be of interest to the DIY Music crowd
    **Overall Advantages**
    - could end up being used to make cool music
    **Disadvantages:**
    - Circuit needs testing
    - how sensitive is circuit to change
 
 
 
 ## Old Fuzz Versions
 
 _As it is looking like Fuzz is the least likely outcome for this project ~TODO: Move these to new repo for fuzz development_
