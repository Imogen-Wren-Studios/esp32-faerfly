 Imogen Wren Business Card PCB - ImmoFuzz
 
 _This project incorperates 2 personal projects I have been meaning to work on into 1 package.
 
 1. A PCB business card I can hand out to people at gigs / work to advertise myself
 2. A Ripping Beast of a fuzz I built many years ago out of recycled parts from old broadcast cameras, and have never successfully managed to replicate.
